## This is Sandover.
<img align="center" width="540" src="images/merrill-jackson-apartment.jpeg">  
<p>A custom <a href="https://www.obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> theme. Sandover is inspired by the spaces in which great works are written and the tools used to write them. The simple design replicates the typewritten page and uses the font TT2020. Accent colors come from the vibrant Stonington, CT home of poet James Merrill and his partner, David Jackson. Their home is one of the primary settings of his epic <i>The Changing Light at Sandover.</i> I created this theme for myself while using Obsidian for my research notes. I wanted an inspiring workspace and the ability to add comments. In Sandover, you can leave blue comments by using blockquote syntax, so that you can easily see them while typing. It's not fancy and won't work for everyone, but I hope that it will fulfill other users' needs as it does mine. The theme is for poets, novelists, academics, and writers of all kinds to use. </p>

<blockquote>
“Backdrop: The dining room at Stonington. <br>
Walls of ready-mixed matte “flame” (a witty <br>
Shade, now watermelon, now sunburn). <br>
Overhead, a turn of the century dome <br>
Expressing white tin wreathes and fleurs-de-lys <br>
In palpable relief to candlelight. <br>
Wallace Stevens, with that dislocated <br>
Perspective of the newly dead, would take it <br>
For an alcove in the Baptist church next door <br>
Whose moonlit tower saw eye to eye with us. <br>
The room breathed sheer white curtains out.” <br>
<footer>James Merrill, <i>The Changing Light at Sandover</i></footer></blockquote>
