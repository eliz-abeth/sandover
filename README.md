## This is Sandover.

A custom theme for <a href="https://www.obsidian.md">Obsidian.</a> Sandover is inspired by the spaces in which great works are written and the tools used to write them. The simple design replicates the typewritten page. Accent colors come from the vibrant Stonington, CT home of Pulitzer Prize-winning poet James Merrill and his partner, David Jackson. Their home is one of the primary settings of his (their?) epic *The Changing Light at Sandover.* I created this theme for myself after a few years of using Obsidian for my research notes. One of Obsidian's biggest drawbacks, for me, is the inability to add comments to the text. I adjusted the base theme settings so that I can leave comments by using blockquote syntax. In Sandover, blockquotes are rendered as indented blue text, so you can easily see them while typing. It's not fancy and won't work for everyone, but I learned CSS to do this so I am working with what I've got. The theme is for poets, novelists, academics, and writers of all kinds to use.

still in beta stage.
