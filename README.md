## This is Sandover.
[!image](images/merrill-jackson-apartment.jpeg)
A custom theme for <a href="https://www.obsidian.md">Obsidian.</a> Sandover is inspired by the spaces in which great works are written and the tools used to write them. This minimal theme recreates the page of a typewriter in its simplicity. Accent colors come from the home of Pulitzer-Prize winning poet James Merrill, and especially his book *The Changing Light at Sandover.* I created this theme for myself while writing my dissertation in Obsidian. It is for poets, novelists, academics, and writers of all kinds to use.

the theme is still in beta stage.
