A custom theme for <a href="https://www.obsidian.md">Obsidian.</a> Sandover is inspired by the spaces in which great works are written and the tools used to write them. The simple design replicates the typewritten page. Accent colors come from the vibrant Stonington, CT home of Pulitzer Prize-winning poet James Merrill and his partner, David Jackson. Their home is one of the primary settings of his (their?) epic *The Changing Light at Sandover.* I created this theme for myself while writing my dissertation in Obsidian, what I call my "home base." The theme is for poets, novelists, academics, and writers of all kinds to use.

the theme is still in beta stage.
