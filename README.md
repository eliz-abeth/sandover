## This is Sandover.
<img src="/images/sandover-intro copy.png">
<p>A custom <a href="https://www.obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> theme. Sandover is inspired by the spaces in which great works are written and the tools used to write them. The simple design replicates the typewritten page and uses the font <a href="https://github.com/ctrlcctrlv/TT2020">TT2020</a>. Headings and bold text support character dissimilarity. Accent colors come from the vibrant Stonington, CT home of poet James Merrill and his partner, David Jackson. Their home is one of the primary settings of his epic <i>The Changing Light at Sandover.</i> I created this theme for myself while using Obsidian for my research notes. </p>

<p>I wanted an inspiring, manuscript-like workspace and the ability to add comments. In Sandover, you can leave blue comments by using blockquote syntax, so that you can easily see them while typing--as if you'd written with blue ink between lines. If you don't like this feature, you can change blockquote text color using the <a hfref="https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings">Style Settings</a> plugin. I hope that it will fulfill other users' needs as it does mine. The theme is for poets, novelists, academics, and writers of all kinds to use. </p>

<p> Compatible with <a href="https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings">Style Settings Plugin</a>. More settings available soon.</p>

<p>The font is encoded so no additional downloads are needed.</p>
